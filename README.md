## Reason
This app was built out of a response to my personal habits, gaming, scrolling social media,
binging shows which I used as a mean of avoidance. It's design to help me not only continue
to find the root cause of what am I avoiding, but replace the old habits with alternative,
healthier acitives. Creating a healthier behavioral pattern.
